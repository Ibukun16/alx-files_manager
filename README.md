# alx-files_manager
This project is a summary of everything learned in the Backend Specialization trimester: authentication, NodeJS, MongoDB, Redis, pagination and background processing. The objective is to build a simple platform to upload and view files:
* User authentication via a token
* List all files
* Upload a new file
* Change permission of a file
* View a file
* Generate thumbnails for images.
The system gives step by step guidance for building it, gave some freedoms of implementation, split in more files etc… (utils folder is your friend).
It’s a learning purpose to assemble each piece and build a full product.
